# H278 Tor Network Client
Educational Project Notice: This is an educational project created to demonstrate and learn how Go interacts with shared memory across different operating systems. The implementation serves as a learning resource for understanding cross-platform shared memory management and network programming in Go.
A high-performance, multi-circuit Tor network client implementation in Go with cross-platform shared memory support.
Overview
H278 is a sophisticated network client that enables concurrent HTTP requests through multiple Tor circuits while maintaining cross-platform compatibility for shared memory operations. The application is designed to handle high-throughput network requests with IP rotation capabilities and comprehensive logging.
Educational Purpose
This project was created to:

Demonstrate shared memory implementation in Go
Show cross-platform compatibility approaches
Illustrate system-level programming concepts
Provide practical examples of Go's syscall interfaces
Showcase proper error handling and resource management

Key Features

Multiple concurrent Tor circuits management
Cross-platform shared memory implementation (Windows/Unix)
Automatic IP rotation
Request queuing and processing
Comprehensive logging and monitoring
Graceful shutdown handling

System Requirements

Go 1.23.2 or higher
Tor service installed and accessible in system PATH

For Unix/Linux: sudo apt-get install tor (Debian/Ubuntu)
For Windows: Download and install from the official Tor website
Verify installation with tor --version in terminal/command prompt


Compatible with Windows and Unix-based systems

Architecture
Core Components

Network Package (/network)

MultiTorClient: Manages multiple Tor circuits
TorCircuit: Individual Tor circuit implementation
Request: HTTP request abstraction


Memory Package (/Memory)

Platform-specific shared memory implementations
Unified interface through SharedMemoryInterface
Separate implementations for Windows and Unix systems


Service Package (/service)

ResponseLogger: Handles request logging and monitoring
Manages client lifecycle and request processing



Memory Management
The application implements a cross-platform shared memory system:

Unix Implementation: Uses POSIX shared memory (shm_open)
Windows Implementation: Uses Windows memory-mapped files
Abstract interface ensuring consistent behavior across platforms

Dependencies
goCopyrequire (
    github.com/cretz/bine v0.2.0
    golang.org/x/net v0.31.0
    golang.org/x/sys v0.27.0
    golang.org/x/crypto v0.29.0
)
Configuration
Shared Memory
goCopysharedMemName := "h278"    // Shared memory identifier
sharedMemSize := 1024*1024 // 1MB size
Network Settings

Default request interval: 5 seconds
Random delay between requests: 600-800ms
Circuit count: 4 (configurable)

Usage
Basic Implementation
goCopypackage main

import (
    "H278/service"
    "log"
)

func main() {
    logger, err := service.NewResponseLogger(
        "your-target-url",
        "h278",    // Shared memory name
        1024*1024, // Shared memory size
    )
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    defer logger.Stop()

    logger.Start()
    // ... handle shutdown
}
Request Configuration
goCopyrequest := network.Request{
    URL:    targetURL,
    Method: "POST",
    Body:   jsonBody,
    Headers: map[string]string{
        "Connection":   "keep-alive",
        "User-Agent":   "BlackDesert",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
}
Testing
The application includes comprehensive test suites:

Client Tests (/tests/Client_test.go)

Circuit initialization
IP rotation
Request processing
Error handling


IP Change Tests (/tests/IpChange_test.go)

Tor connection validation
IP rotation verification
Response timing tests



Run tests using:
bashCopygo test ./tests/...
Security Considerations

Network Security

All requests are routed through Tor circuits
Automatic IP rotation for anonymity
Configurable request delays to prevent detection


Memory Security

Secure shared memory implementation
Proper cleanup on shutdown
Memory access permissions handling



Error Handling
The application implements comprehensive error handling:

Circuit initialization failures
Network request errors
Shared memory errors
Graceful cleanup on failures

Performance Considerations

Concurrent circuit management
Configurable delay between requests
Memory-efficient shared data handling
Automatic resource cleanup

Limitations

Requires local Tor service installation
Memory size limited by system constraints
Network performance dependent on Tor network

Best Practices

Configuration

Adjust shared memory size based on requirements
Configure appropriate request delays
Set reasonable circuit count


Monitoring

Monitor response times
Track IP rotation success
Log error patterns


Maintenance

Regular Tor service updates
Monitor memory usage
Review log patterns
